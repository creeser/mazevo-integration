# mazevo-integration

I recenty needed to embed Mazevo calendar events (https://www.gomazevo.com/) on a client website. In case anyone is attempting to do that, I'm sharing my work. 

The page template is for emedding events into a wordpress template. Because I wanted a searchable/sortable/paginated display, my rendering relies on jQuery DataTable. So you'd need to add those libraries as well to control the display:
https://cdn.datatables.net/v/dt/dt-1.11.2/datatables.min.js
https://cdn.datatables.net/v/dt/dt-1.11.2/datatables.min.css

The widget does what it says in the tin. Nothing fancy.
